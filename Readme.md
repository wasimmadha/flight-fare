# Flight Fare Prediction

This project aims to solve the problem of predicting the predicting the Flight Fare price, using Sklearn's supervised machine learning techniques. It is a classification problem and predictions are carried out on dataset, Several regression techniques have been studied, including XGboost and Random forests of decision trees.
